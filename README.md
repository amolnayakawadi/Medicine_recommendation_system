Project Title = Medicine Recommendation System

## Project Description
### Medicine Recommendation System
The Medicine Recommendation System is a sophisticated tool designed to assist healthcare professionals and patients in selecting the most appropriate medications based on individual needs and preferences. By leveraging a comprehensive medicine dataset and advanced machine learning techniques, this system provides personalized recommendations, enhancing the decision-making process in healthcare.

This project utilizes Python for data processing and machine learning, Jupyter Notebook for development and analysis, and HTML for the user interface. The system integrates various features, such as filtering by symptoms, patient history, and medication interactions, to ensure safe and effective recommendations.

## Business Statement
The Medicine Recommendation System is an AI-powered chatbot that provides personalized medication advice based on user queries and conditions. It uses advanced machine learning and natural language processing to deliver accurate and timely recommendations, improving patient care and reducing the need for in-person consultations.

## Workflow
User Interaction: The user initiates a conversation with the chatbot through the interface.

Query Processing: The chatbot receives and processes the user’s query, extracting relevant information about symptoms or conditions.

Data Analysis: The system analyzes the query using machine learning models and natural language processing techniques to understand the user’s needs.

Recommendation Generation: Based on the analysis, the system generates personalized medicine recommendations or advice.

Response Delivery: The chatbot delivers the recommendations to the user in a clear and understandable format.

User Feedback: The user can provide feedback on the recommendations, which is used to improve the system’s accuracy and performance.

Integration and Updates: The system integrates with healthcare databases for up-to-date information and continuously updates its knowledge base.

Monitoring and Support: Regular monitoring and maintenance are conducted to ensure the system operates efficiently and to address any issues that arise.

How to Run the Project
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
Python 3.6 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

Installation

1.Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/amolnayakawadi/medicine-recommendation-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd medicine-recommendation-system


2.Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`


3.Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt


4.Running the Jupyter Notebook
Start Jupyter Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook from the project directory:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
This command will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.

5.Open the Project Notebook
In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to and open the main notebook file (medicine_recommendation_system.ipynb).

6.Run the Cells
Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially. This will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and display the results.


7.Running the Web Interface (if applicable)
Navigate to the Web Directory
If your project includes a web interface, navigate to the web directory:
bash
Copy code
cd web

8.Start the Flask Server
Start the Flask server to host the web application:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to interact with the medicine recommendation system.
